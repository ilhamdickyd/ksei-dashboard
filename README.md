## About The Project

The KSEI Financial Dashboard was built to tackle the challenge of interpreting complex, raw financial data. By transforming tabular data into intuitive and interactive visualizations, this tool empowers stakeholders‚Äîfrom retail investors to analysts‚Äîto easily explore and understand the dynamics of Indonesia's capital market.

The dashboard focuses on three core perspectives: overall financial asset distribution, domestic investor demographics, and individual investor profiles.

## Key Features

- üìä **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Deep dive into three main financial categories: Asset Distribution, Domestic Investor Spread, and Individual Investor Demographics.
- üìà **Interactive Visualizations:** Utilizes a variety of charts including line charts for monthly trends, bar charts for comparisons, and donut charts for proportional distribution.
- üîç **Dynamic Filtering:** Allows users to filter and compare data by year (2021-2024), month, category, region, and various demographic factors.
- üìë **Three-Layered Tabs:** Each data category is organized into `Overview`, `Analysis`, and `Comparison` tabs, offering different depths of insight.

## Technology Stack

This dashboard was built using a modern, scalable, and type-safe tech stack.

| **Frontend** | `React`, `Next.js`, `TypeScript` |
| **Styling** | `Tailwind CSS`, `shadcn/ui` |

2.  **Domestic Investor Spread:** Presents the geographical distribution of investors across major Indonesian regions (Java, Sumatera, Kalimantan, etc.).
3.  **Individual Investor Demographics:** Provides insights into investor profiles based on gender, age, occupation, education, and income level.
